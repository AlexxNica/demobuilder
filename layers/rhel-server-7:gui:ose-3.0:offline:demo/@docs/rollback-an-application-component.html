## Rollback an application component

These steps demonstrate how a developer could rollback an unwanted
change to an application component running on OpenShift.

1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
1. Type `oc rollback monster-1` and press `ENTER`.
1. Type `exit` and press `ENTER` to close the terminal window.
1. Return to Firefox and wait for OpenShift to rollback the application.
1. Navigate to the application front page, and press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to
   refresh it.  In due course you should find that the change you made earlier
   has been reverted.
