## Create an application hosted on OpenShift from source code

These steps demonstrate how to import a simple application into OpenShift from a
git source tree, and have OpenShift build and deploy the application.  The steps
demonstrate how easy it is to get started with OpenShift.

**Note that due to a known issue, currently you will need Internet access to
follow this step.**

1. Click the *New Project* button.
1. Type `test` in the *Name* box and click *Create*.
1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Type `git://openshift.example.com/github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex#master` in
   the *Repository URL* box and click *Next*.
1. Select the *nodejs:0.10* builder image.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. `CTRL`-click the application URL
   (*http://nodejs-ex-demo.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a new
   tab.
1. Click the *OPENSHIFT ENTERPRISE* logo in the top left of the OpenShift web
   user interface to return to the *Projects* list.
1. Click the *Delete Project* icon next to the *test* project, then click
   *Delete this project*.  **IMPORTANT**: do not delete the *demo* or *prod*
   projects.
