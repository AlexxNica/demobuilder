# This file defines a list of VM images, one per line, to be built
# automatically as a combination of multiple layers.  For example, the
# line rhel-server-6.5:gui:openshift:rhev would create a RHEL server
# 6.5 base image, add the GUI and OpenShift layers, and provide an
# output image ready to be imported into RHEV.
